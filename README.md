# Decorator
 # Python Learning Journey - Day 7  ðŸŽ‰ Celebrating Day 7 of my Python learning journey! ðŸš€ Today, I delved into the fascinating world of decorators and unlocked a new level of Python wizardry! âœ¨ Decorators are like magic spells that enhance the functionality of functions, adding extra powers without altering their core essence. ðŸ’« With decorators, I can now elegantly modify and extend the behavior of my Python functions, making my code more flexible and reusable. ðŸ’» Feeling empowered and excited to integrate decorators into my programming arsenal! ðŸ’¡   ## What I Learned Today  - Explored the concept of decorators in Python - Learned how decorators can enhance the functionality of functions - Practiced applying decorators to modify and extend the behavior of Python functions  ## Tomorrow's Learning Goals  Excited to dive deeper into Python and explore advanced topics like object-oriented programming and file handling! ðŸ“š   ## My Portfolio  Check out my [portfolio](https://singh-3d-portfolio.netlify.app/) to see some of my projects and creations! ðŸŒŸ  ## Connect with Me  Let's connect on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/vishalvs7) and continue our coding journey together! ðŸ˜Š   Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
